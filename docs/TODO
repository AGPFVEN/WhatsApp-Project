Annotations:
    - Static has all the css and js files

To do: 
    Registration:
        frontend:
            design landing page
            CURRENTLY: save user session (in local browser session data)
                Algorithm:
                    1. User gets a qr code (done)
                    2. User sends qr code to server (in order to get response with encrypted response)
                        The phone number is encrypted in order to avoid impersonating other user
                    3. User gets hash value
                    4. User stores hash value 
                Considerations:
                    - Use hash to encrypt phone number and upload it to azure
                    - Not use hash to encrypt user session in cloud (Symmetric or Asymmetric cryto)
                    - Encrypt web storage in the cloud
                        the most secure approach would be to encrypt in the user side (but it would make the user experience worse)
            
To do (later):
    Create circular queue of actions system
    Disable headless option

    Create frontend:
        -Design page
        -Loading page initial page

        -Pop-ups así: https://www.edureka.co/blog/understanding-structures-and-padding-in-c/
        -Registration page

        -Métodos de pago:
            -ApplePay
            -Tarjeta Bancaria

        -Solution: Async Web Request Flow
            -Tools:
                - javascript -> XMLHttpRequest
                - golang     -> POST?

                - js send    -> http.FileServe
                - js minimize-> Build tool (WebPack or Rollup)


Solved:
    Registration:
        Qr extraction
        Show qr to user
        Session management (get browser session from user)
        Autoregister (get browser data and phone number)
        Compress files
        Upload wss files (done):
            Azure:

                    Use python example applied to go project. Spent 5+ hours following useless tutorials
                Progress:
                    Quickstart microsoft app done (permisions and local implementations successfully done)

To run:
