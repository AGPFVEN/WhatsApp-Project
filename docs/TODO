To do: 
    Registration:
        frontend:
            design landing page
            CURRENTLY: save phone number (in local browser session data)
                To do this I will use a database to relate the user phone number with the user qr session data
                This is done because the user needs to use a get to request info from the server
            use hash to encrypt phone number and upload it to azure
            encrypt web storage in the cloud
                the most secure approach would be to encrypt in the user side (but it would make the user experience worse)
